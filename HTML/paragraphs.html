    following online tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp

    -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>paragraphs</title>
</head>
<body>

    <p>This is a normal paragraph with normal spaces</p>

    <!-- will display all on one line -->
    <p>This also    appears to be a normal paragraph    but it has     
     some weird spacing and line breaks

      in the code. But 
    the browser        ignores    it and displays normal text</p>

    <!-- use <br> for new lines -->
    <p>You can also <br>arbitrarily <br>insert line breaks</p>

    <!-- <pre> = preformatted text, preserves formatting 
        fixed width font, usually Courier -->
    <pre>
        Preformatted text preserves formatting
        It saves
            all
                the
                    spaces

        and displays them as written
    </pre>
